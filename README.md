when running the chatbot.ipynb you will need to run the terminal on google colab so after doing that make sure to run this command first 
(curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh)
then you have to run this command 
(ollama serve & ollama pull llama3)
if it didn't work then you should run it again then it will work
