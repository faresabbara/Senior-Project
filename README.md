when running the chatbot.ipynb you will need to run the terminal so after doing that make sure to run this command first 
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
then you have to run this command 
ollama serve & ollama pull llama3
if it didn't work then you should run it again then it will work
